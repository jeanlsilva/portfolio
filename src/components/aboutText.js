                I'm Jean Silva, born and raised in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and currently living in Toronto, Canada. My first
                contact with the world of programming was in 2011, during my technician course in informatics. It was there 
                where I learnt how that magic world works, and since then, I've been working tirelessly to become an specialist 
                in that matter, and thus contributing to small and mid-sized companies to achieve its goals by offering efficient, 
                adaptative and attractive solutions as Web and Mobile applications.
